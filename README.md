# PEXIT-Protograph-LDPC-codes-design-based-on-EXIT-analysis
This is a Python implementation of the paper "Protograph LDPC codes design based on EXIT analysis" by Gianluigi Liva and Marco Chiani. 


I think the input to the file needs a base matrix B that describes the protograph. Input also needs punctured nodes.
